The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

"Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
"I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
"Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

boilerplate
------------
usage of code repeatedly 

steps
------
install
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install react-redux

create slice using createSlice method which returns both actions and reducers automatically
export actions and reducer seperately since action is need for components and reduce is need for store
create store usinge cofigurestore method
place the reducer in the reducer key
make the state in the store globally accessible by wrapping the app components(root component) inside the provider tag
use dispatch hook to call action
useSelecter hook is used to access the state

Advantage
----------
1)easy Configure store
2)reduce installation of large amount of packages
3)eliminate boilerplate code
